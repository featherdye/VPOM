In a democracy for a political discourse to be
fruitful, the citizen should exercise their right to
free speech in drastic ways. While the internet
was supposed to support democracy, in its
ubiquity it has become strangely out of touch
with the local.

This app is a virtual mic to broadcast your voice
in a 100 meter radius. What you say can only
be heard by people who stumble upon this
particular mic. They can reply, raise a new topic
or ignore and move on.

Work in progress.
